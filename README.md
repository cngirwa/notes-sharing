# Notes Sharing App
This Android application will enable users to;
1. Write notes.
2. Share notes via other applications.

## App flow structure
The App will have the following flow;
1. User login using Google Sign-in options.
2. Create a note by adding a title and contents.
3. Share a note to friends via other applications.

## Technology and features used
The App uses SQLite database to store data locally, and firebase realtime database to store/authenticate users' login credentials. The App will ask only once, the user to Sign-in and then automatically Sign-in a user next time he/she opens the App. Material design is used as the theme, hence the interactions and operations are smooth and easy to operate.

## About App
1. Easy to Sign-in.
2. Can be used offline once Sign-in.
3. Sign-out functionality.

## Improvements needed
1. Good user interface.
2. More functionality (example: Color notes by their priority, create a collaborative notes sharing).
3. Online backup of database (automatic or on-demand).
